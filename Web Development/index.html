<h1> This Cat Contemplates the Existence of Intelligent Life Elsewhere in the Universe After Witnessing the Biggest Bruh Moment in History.</h1>
<h2>After seeing his owner throw his phone into the blender rather than fruit, Catto decided to take a moment to contemplate why humans are considered the most intelligent species known.</h2>
<p> "When I saw Greg throw his talking box into the fruit musher machine, I was reconsidering why the humans think they're so smart. He can say that he hadn't had his coffee, but I'm a cat. I know better than him. Foolish Greg, that's what I call him." </p>

 <p> Catto's owner, Greg, who is 24 years of age, has rebutted by saying: "Listen, I understand that my cat has some harsh opinions about me. But the fact that he's losing faith in humanity as a whole just for my mistake is going a little out of hand. I didn't even get my coffee yet!" Catto has ignored this rebuttal and has moved forward with his pondering. </p>
 <br>
 <p> "Typical human. You can't fool me, foolish Greg." said Catto while staring off at the sunset. </p>
